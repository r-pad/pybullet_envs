# This is required to allow us to have notebooks/ at the top level.
# The reason we included .../environments is because it's the only way to include
# a package, since it is the lowest in the chain with an __init__.py file. Otherwise
# we could have just included all the way down to assets/ur5/suction, but for
# some reason that wasn't working in 3.9. Don't fully understand, cuz it was working
# in 3.10. Whatever.
